# fNIRS Deep Learning Research Paper Reference

Many deep learning methods for feature extraction in EEG data can be applied to fNIRS datasets. This folder contains a collection of research papers and repositories (if any) that I used as references for developing deep learning-based feature extraction for fNIRS data with our dataset.
